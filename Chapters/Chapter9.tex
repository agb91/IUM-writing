\section{Conclusions}

In this cyclical process of development, after much trying and re-trying, we can surely say that we have tested a lot of different ways to give the user the best possible product. The big modifications between different stages, both the ones derived from the pilot users, and the ones derived from the general users probably identified the most of the problems on this application, that now, with the final version are hopefully solved.

The main advantages that we have enjoyed during the development is surely related to the possibility to get hints from the pilot users, that are both users and supervisors, and surely gave a big help to correctly interpret the needs of the typical users. Also the availability of the general users to test the application and to help with ideas and opinions was surely important.

I conclusion we must observe that the needs of the users are not stable, are continuously changing, so, even if gAn Web is designed to be easy to modify, the biggest challenge for the future is try to maintain the application up to date in a unstable and dynamic environment.

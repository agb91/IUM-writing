Modifications:
\begin{enumerate}

\item The dropdown menu "Runs to show" allows the user to select only the images produced by a single run (by default the system shows the images related to all the runs). The users widely use this option, because in this way they can compare images extrapolated in the same way but related with runs with different configurations.

\item "Download All Images" allows the user to download by a single click all the images related to the execution. The late design introduces this requirement because commonly the users want to download the images using the right click of the mouse and the browser's button "Save Image As". In this way this process is faster and easier.

\item The buttons "Back to Previous page" and "Back to Home" are links towards the textual output page and the homepage. They are in fixed position.

\item By clicking on the image the user reaches a page that shows the image in full screen, but not in a static format: the image is dynamically accessible like shown in the following images:
